# rl_urban_baselines

Reinforcement Learning Baselines (OpenAI) applied to Autonomous Driving

This Research is aiming to address RL approaches to solve 3 Urban scenarios: Roundabout, Merging and Urban/Street navigation.

The objective is to compare performances of well known RL algorithms (Open AI baselines) in these environments.

The research will also address the differences (advantages and disadvantages) between Continuous and Discrete Action Spaces. 

The Original version of these environments were created by Edouard Leurent and can be found in https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env
